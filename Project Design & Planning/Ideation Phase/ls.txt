In particular, it was discovered that ecologists monitor them to determine the factors causing population
 fluctuation and to help in conserving and managing threatened and endangered species. 
The various surveys used in counting species including data collection techniques were succinctly reviewed. 
It was established that a small but growing number of researchers have studied the use of computer vision for monitoring species.


John Martinsson et al (2017), presented the CNN algorithm and deep residual neural networks to 
detect an image in two ways i.e., based on feature extraction and signal classification. 
They did an experimental analysis for datasets consisting of different images.
 But their work didnâ€™t consider the background species. In Order to identify the background species larger 
volumes of training data are required, which may not be available.

 Juha Niemi, Juha T Tanttu et al (2018) , proposed a Convolutional neural network trained with deep learning algorithms for image classification. 
It also proposed a data augmentation method in which images are converted and rotated in accordance with the desired color. 
The final identification is based on a fusion of parameters provided by the radar and predictions of the image classifier
Madhuri A. Tayal, Atharva Magrulkar et al (2018), developed a software application that is used to simplify the species identification process. 
This species identification software takes an image as an input and gives the identity of the species as an output.
 The technology used is transfer learning and MATLAB for the identification process.
